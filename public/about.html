<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a 46 year old Web Development student living in Melbourne Florida I enjoy the beach, bike riding, taking walks with Hunter the dog, hanging out with my Mother, who is the Author in the family and spending time with my big brother Richard and
  his husband Joe when we can all get together. I plan on finishing my full stack web development self learning course in a couple of months and then moving on to Python programming. I would like to attend a coding bootcamp in the near future once my
  self taught studies have prepared me for more rigorous education with a more structured environment.
